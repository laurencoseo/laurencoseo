### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on strengthening my Java skills and building up a portfolio.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to connect Java back end code to the front end. I want to create applications that people can use outside of the command line.

ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Java or Android Studio projects.

ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding APIs.

ğŸ’¬ Ask me about books I've read lately or my recent trips.
